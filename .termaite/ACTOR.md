   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route("/")
   def hello_world():
       return "Hello, World!"

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

3. **Run your Flask app**:
   Execute the following command in your terminal to run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see the "Hello, World!" message.
