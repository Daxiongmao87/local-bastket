I would like to allow non-sellers to add stands they find.  This would help bootstrap the app.  It would essentially allow a user to create a 'shop' just like a seller, it would just be unverified.  Each one of these would have a link stating "Is this yours? Claim it" to allow a user who happened to actually wanted to sell but their stand/shop was already tagged by a user.  We also should have a 'Problem? Report this posting" or something similar for any shop verified/unverified.
