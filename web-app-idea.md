This idea is a web app that allows homesteaders and local homesteaders and farmers who sell eggs, vegetables, and even fire wood on out in front of their property to post their location along with what they sell on this mobile-friendly PWA.  The app should be relatively simple and self-explanatory in function.  When I go to the website, I would be greeted to a friendly and welcoming page, using earthen and organic color tones with a sort of artisan font.  It would have a brief explanation of the website's mission, with two hero buttons, one to find local produce near me, and the other to "set up shop" so to speak.

As a seller, if i push the button to set up shop, I would be taken to a login page with the option to register.  When I go to register, I enter my email and password and confirm password (provide ability to view password which is common now a days), I would be sent a confirmation email.  After confirming, I am redirected to the log in page again.  Once I log in, it would be nice if it remembers I was trying to set up shop and it would take me to the setup page.  There I can give my 'shop' a banner image, a name, I can put in my address or use location services if available on the device, and I can add an optional description, optional hours, optional contact info, and (required) list of items (predefined list of items with labels and icons) and prices I'm selling (selectable with the option for a custom with a choice of icon) with the ability to add descriptions to each item and even photos if I would like, and (required) payment options that I can set up, such as zelle, venmo, paypal, and the easiest, cash.  For zelle, venmo, or paypal, I can just provide a URL to the QR code or payment page to make it simple.  I can also toggle whether or not items I've listed are sold out or out of stock or when they are available.  I can also toggle the whole shop open or closed, or even automate the open/closed based on the ours I put in, with the option to override this automation in case I want to close for a specific reason.  The shop would be closed by default, allowing me to review if I'm ready to.  At the bottom of my page would be a list of reviews, starting with the average rating and the reviews below, with hte ability to leave a response.

As a buyer, if I push the button to find local produce near me, I am taken to the map view, and asked if the app could use my location, or I can enter an address at the top.  The map would show icons of sellers near me, and at the bottom, a list of sellers sorted by nearest.  There will be an option to search by item, filter open/closed/hours, and sort by distance, rating, and relevance.  Tapping on a seller would provide me their page, containing their information, hours, etc., and what they sell, and their payment options.  Tapping on whichever payment options they have available outside of cash, I can access their payment method of choice.  I can register an account, entering my email and password, which i can confirm via email.  Once confirmed, it would be nice if it would remember that i was browsing a certain page at the time I hit the register or log in button.  Now logged in, i can leave a rating and review.

The web app would be free, with minimal ads.  For now, I'd like the app to be simply a flask web app that is a PWA with responsive and modern design
